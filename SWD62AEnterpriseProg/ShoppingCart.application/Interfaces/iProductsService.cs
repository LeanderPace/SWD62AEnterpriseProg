        // hence we create a replica of that class removing any properties which may disclose some confidential or 
        // unwanted information
        // typical eg. if you have a user class, would you pass on the password? No. So thats why we create these view models

        // IQueryable<Product> GetProducts(); wrong

        IQueryable<ProductViewModel> GetProducts(); // correct

        //void RateProduct(Guid id, string comment, double rating);
